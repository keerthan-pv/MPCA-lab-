Microprocessor and Computer Architecture (MPCA)
This repository contains resources, notes, and implementations related to Microprocessor and Computer Architecture (MPCA). It covers fundamental concepts, including:

Microprocessor Basics: Architecture, instruction sets, and interfacing

Assembly Language Programming: Writing and executing low-level code

Memory Organization: Cache, RAM, ROM, and storage hierarchy

Computer Architecture: Pipelining, parallel processing, and performance optimization

I/O Systems and Peripherals: Interfacing external devices with processors

The goal of this repository is to provide a structured and practical approach to understanding microprocessors and computer architecture concepts through examples and code implementations.
